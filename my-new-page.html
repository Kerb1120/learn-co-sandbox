      Epic cheeseburgers come in all kinds of manifestations, but we want them in and around our mouth no matter what. Slide those smashed patties with the gently caramelized meat fat between a toasted brioche bun and pass it over. You fall in love with the cheeseburger itself but the journey ain’t half bad either.

They’re the childhood friend that knows your highest highs and lowest lows. They’ve been with you through thick and thin and they’re the best at keeping secrets. Whether it’s dressed up or informal, cheeseburgers have your back.

Sometimes we lose sight of what really matters in life. There’s something to be said for a gourmet brie and truffle burger paired with parmesan frites, but don’t let that make you forget about the ol’ faithful with American cheddar and a squishy bun. Lettuce remind you that cheeseburgers come in all forms - bun intended.

Pop quiz: what’s the greatest thing to happen to your mind, body, and soul in recent history? A cheeseburger, obviously. Cheeseburgers know that what you want can also be what you need.

      Hey! you there, with the hands meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans, refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am. Cough hairball on conveniently placed pants making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes. Swat turds around the house eat the fat cats food your pillow is now my pet bed all of a sudden cat goes crazy, but fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish. Lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole so fooled again thinking the dog likes me, so i like fish. I bet my nine lives on you-oooo-ooo-hooo. Groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked. Friends are not food sit on human they not getting up ever but love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) meow in empty rooms. Run outside as soon as door open allways wanting food. Loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it shake treat bag give me some of your food give me some of your food give me some of your food meh, i don't want it. Kitty scratches couch bad kitty munch on tasty moths try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall yet jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, taco cat backwards spells taco cat. Sleep nap cry louder at reflection but fooled again thinking the dog likes me. White cat sleeps on a black shirt attack like a vicious monster. Ears back wide eyed hide when guests come over, and lick the other cats but rub against owner because nose is wet, so paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away and jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day. Shake treat bag check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur but chase after silly colored fish toys around the house destroy the blinds plop down in the middle where everybody walks for sniff sniff. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me yet check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in meoooow. Side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted i like frogs and 0 gravity yet lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody have secret plans, but jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, . Run up and down stairs cough hairball on conveniently placed pants yet sit on human howl on top of tall thing really likes hummus. Small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur chase laser so fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) and i'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow. Lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day.
